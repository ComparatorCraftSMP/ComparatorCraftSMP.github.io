							<p>
								<i>
									All of the following rules apply to ANY AND ALL official ComparatorCraftSMP
									Minecraft
									Servers, Discord Servers, communication platforms, websites, forums, and
									comments to
									any of our social media. Any staff reserve the right to punish you on any and
									all
									ComparatorCraftSMP properties if you violate any of our guidelines. This also
									applies
									to any attempts, successful or otherwise, to exploit any loopholes you may find.
									Staff
									also have the right to change, add, or remove any rules if they deem it
									necessary.
								</i>
								<br>
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								If you leave the Discord server during a punishment <em>(i.e. tempban or
									mute)</em>
								you will be banned.
							</blockquote>
							<h3 class="align-center" id="age-restriction">Age restriction</h3>
							<p>
								We do have a 15+ age restriction. We don't mind taking in 14-years who show a lot of
								talent, skill and passion for the game but generally we're 15+.
							</p>
							<h3 class="align-center" id="warning-structure">Warning Structure</h3>
							<p>
								You are entitled up to 3 warnings from staff before you will be muted on the next
								transgression. Violate our rules again, and you will have a 1 week mute. A further
								violation will warrant a temporary ban from the Minecraft server in addition to a
								mute on our Discord server.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								Any and all staff can punish, ban, mute, kick, and warn players if they have evidence
								that a rule was violated on the server. All evidence will be presented to the punished
								party.
							</blockquote>
							<hr>
							<h2 id="chat">Chat</h2>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<strong>Don't be that person.</strong> &mdash; We have no place on our server for
									hate speech. <br>
									<i>(Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Xenophobia, Transphobia, etc.)</i>
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Respect all cultures.</strong> &mdash; We have people from all around the
									world. Please
									avoid topics based on politics or religion.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>It's not always banter.</strong> &mdash; Use common sense. Try not to
									intentionally trigger, annoy, or hurt someone. It might be harmless to you but
									to some people it can be hurtful. Think before you speak!
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>SFW only.</strong> &mdash; Please don't send porn, gore, or overly edgy
									memes and videos. Also, don't talk about gross, gory, or lewd activities. We don't
									mind shitposting but don't take it too far.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Don't spam.</strong> &mdash; This is straightforward. Avoid filling any chat
									with repeated messages or similar messages.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<hr>
							<h2 id="griefing">Griefing/Stealing</h2>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<strong>Griefing.</strong> &mdash; If mine blocks, ignite TNT, kill mobs, place
									any new blocks without consent, or are the direct cause of destruction in a
									community
									build or players build: That counts as griefing.
									<blockquote>
										<em>
											If you accidentally cause destruction on a aplayers base or build: Contact
											the player or staff immediately.
										</em>
									</blockquote>
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>No player killing/trapping without consent.</strong> &mdash; Killing a
									player
									without their consent for PvP is not OK. If you're the cause of another player's
									death
									that counts as PvP.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Stealing.</strong> &mdash; This applies to looting chests AND taking placed
									blocks.
									<blockquote>
										<em>
											We monitor player's interactions with chests heavily. You can't get away
											with stealing.
										</em>
									</blockquote>
								</li>
							</ol>
							<hr>
							<h2 id="exploits">Exploits</h2>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<strong>Exploits.</strong> &mdash; Anything that gives an unfair advantage should
									not
									be usesd and if discovered should be reported to staff immediately. See exceptions
									below.
									<br>
									<i>
										(If you have discovered an exploit, please open a report/support
										ticket.)
									</i>

											discord,
											plugin, and datapack exploits. Not to mention exploits in Minecraft itself.
										</em>
									</blockquote>
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Seed X-Ray / Math Mining.</strong> &mdash; No seed-based x-raying or math
									mining
									in any way.
									<i>(Don't use seed generation and seed exploits to find diamonds.)</i>
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Lag Machines / Intentional Lag.</strong> &mdash; Do not intentionally
									degrade
									server performance
									with machines, excessive entities, redstone, or otherwise. All redstone contraptions
									should be togglable
									or default to the off position when possible.
									<blockquote>
										<h3>Allowed Exceptions</h3>
										<em>
											Also if your farm is laggy: Staff reserve the right to ask you to turn
											certain
											machines off. If
											you're afking and the server is lagging: Staff also reserve the right to
											kick/tempban you from
											the server.
										</em>
									</blockquote>
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Duping.</strong> &mdash; Duping items through any method is not permitted
									except in the exceptions outlined below.
								</li>
								<blockquote>

							<h2 id="hacking">Hacking/Banned Mods</h2>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<strong>Hacked Clients</strong> &mdash; Not allowed for any reason. 3rd party
									clients such as Lunar Client
									are OK provided features do not give a distinct gameplay advantage. If in doubt, ask
									in #support.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Banned Mods</strong> &mdash; Mods such as X-Ray or Entity Tracking and more
									are not allowed. You can view a full list of banned mods below. If in doubt, ask
									staff.
									<blockquote>
										<em>
											This includes Baraitone and x-ray texture packs.
										</em>
									</blockquote>
								</li>
							</ol>
							<h2 id="advertising">Advertising</h2>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<strong>Advertising</strong> &mdash; Don't send any server IPs, Discord server
									invites,
									or website/forum links to any other Minecraft server without staff approval. This
									also
									includes mentioning a separate Minecraft server's name.
									<blockquote>
										<em>
											An exception to this rule is insanely popular servers like Hypixel, Hive,
											CubeCraft, etc. As well as YouTuber SMPs, SMPs that don't actively recruit,
											or SMPs that don't send out whitelist applications like HermitCraft,
											SciCraft,
											TIS Trinity, DreamSMP, ProtoTech, etc.
										</em>
									</blockquote>
								</li>
							</ol>
							<h2 id="illegal-content">Illegal Content/Piracy</h2>

								<li>
									<strong>Illegal Content/Piracy</strong> &mdash; Do not share, mention, or teach/show
									methods of illegally obtaining content. This includes sharing links, sharing
									tutorials,

										</em>
									</blockquote>

									everything in rule 1 also applies when you're in voice chat.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Volume</strong> &mdash; Please avoid intentionally changing your
									microphone settings to make it super loud and obnoxious.
								</li>
								<li>

									then instantly leave the call.
