This is ComparatorCraftSMPs official website, it is a W.I.P but all the code is here and your welcome to use it for your own website. Keep in mind that this is a template (read below), but it is hosted on github pages. We will hopefully use this as our main website and with enough SEO it should help us advertise the server.

A dark, slick, modern, responsive, adjective-drenched design built around an extremely
dynamic landing page (scroll that mofo!). Inspired by Big Picture, another design
of mine with a similarish feel/flow, only this time I took it waaaaaay further and
actually made it multipurpose (versus copping out and making it a one pager like I
did last time ;) Includes multiple pages, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and all
its Sass sources.
